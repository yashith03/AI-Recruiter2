  ΓùÅ CreateOptions 
Component ΓÇ║ renders both 
create options

    Element type is 
invalid: expected a string 
(for built-in components) 
or a class/function (for 
composite components) but 
got: undefined. You likely 
forgot to export your 
component from the file 
it's defined in, or you 
might have mixed up default 
and named imports.

    Check the render method 
of `CreateOptions`.

    Element type is 
invalid: expected a string 
(for built-in components) 
or a class/function (for 
composite components) but 
got: undefined. You likely 
forgot to export your

    Check the render method
